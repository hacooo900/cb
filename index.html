<h2>SUBINTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
  Earth is made up of three layers that is core, mantle and crust.
  The center is called Core which generally very hot.
  The outer layer is call crust and in between core and crust, the middle part is known as mantle.
  We live on outer layer which is made of rocks.
  Along with human earth is home to millions of species and plants.
  The presence of water on the surface of the earth and air in the atmosphere makes life possible here.
  As only livable planet of the sun we should respect and protect our earth from our wrong practices.
  Like other planets earth also moves around the Sun in a fixed way called orbit.
  It takes 364 days and 6 hours to complete a round around the Sun. Which we count as a year.
  Along with the movement, Earth also rotates on its axis from east to west and complete a rotation in 24 hours which we call a solar day.
  In that rotation, some of the places on earth face sun and other places get hide from the sun alternatively, which we experienced as day and night.</p>

         <h2>EARTH CORE</h2>
         <p>
         More than 5,000 kilometres beneath us, Earth‚Äôs solid metal inner core wasn‚Äôt discovered until 1936.
         Almost a century later, we‚Äôre still struggling to answer basic questions about when and how it first formed.
         These aren‚Äôt easy puzzles to solve.
         We can‚Äôt directly sample the inner core, so the key to unravelling its mysteries lies in collaboration between seismologists, who indirectly sample it with seismic waves, geodynamicists,
         who create models of its dynamics, and mineral physicists, who study the behaviour of iron alloys at high pressures and temperatures.
         Combining these disciplines, scientists have delivered an important clue about what‚Äôs happening miles beneath our feet.
         In a new study, they reveal how Earth‚Äôs inner core is growing faster on one side than the other, which could help explain
         how old the inner core is, and the intriguing history of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field.

       <td><h2>EARLY EARTH</h2>
       <p>Earth‚Äôs core was formed very early in our planet‚Äôs 4.5 billion-year history,
         within the first 200 million years. Gravity pulled the heavier iron to the centre of the young planet,
         leaving the rocky, silicate minerals to make up the mantle and crust.
         Earth‚Äôs formation captured a lot of heat within the planet.
         The loss of this heat, and heating by ongoing radioactive decay,
         have since driven our planet‚Äôs evolution. Heat loss in Earth‚Äôs interior drives the vigorous flow in the liquid iron outer core,
         which creates Earth‚Äôs magnetic field. Meanwhile, cooling within Earth‚Äôs deep interior helps power plate tectonics,
         which shape the surface of our planet.
